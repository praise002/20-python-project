# Clipboard

Creating a clipboard-like functionality in Python involves managing a data structure (e.g., a dictionary) to store text snippets associated with keywords and implementing functions to interact with this storage.

## Clipboard Functionality Overview:

A clipboard typically has the following operations:

1. **Copy**: Copying text or data to the clipboard.
2. **Paste**: Retrieving and pasting text or data from the clipboard.

`clip.py` saves you the stress of writing to files. If you want to get started quickly without working with files, this is a good start.
`clipboard.py` this is the updated and comprehensive program that allows you to persist data by storing it in a file in json format.
